<!-- Rational Function Section -->

  <p>\( y = 1.2 \frac{1}{0.12(x + 2.2)} - 6.8 \)</p>
  <h2> Transformations </h2>
  <p>
We found an image of a roller coaster with part of its construction resembling the graph of a rational function. We modeled it using transformations of the parent function \( y = \frac{1}{x} \) in the form \( y = a\frac{1}{k(x - d)} + c \). First, we determined that our function needed to be vertically stretched. Since we did not want a vertical compression or a reflection across the x-axis, the value of “a” had to be greater than 1. Therefore, we applied a vertical stretch by a factor of 1.2. Next, we observed that the function needed to be horizontally stretched. We knew that for a horizontal stretch, the value of “k” must be greater than 0 but less than 1. Therefore, we applied a horizontal stretch by a factor of \(  \frac{1}{0.12} \). Then, we noticed that the graph needed to be shifted horizontally 2.2 units to the left, so the value of “d” is (−2.2). Finally, the graph needed to be shifted vertically 6.8 units downward, so the value of “c” is (−6.8). After applying all of these transformations, we substituted the values into our formula and obtained the equation: \( y = 1.2 \frac{1}{0.12(x + 2.2)} - 6.8 \).
</p>
  <h2>Domain and range</h2>
 <p>
We needed to put restrictions to our function to make it fit the certain part of the roller coaster, that is why we used the intervals from (-1.4) to 4.8. The range was found by tracing the corresponding y-values at x=(−1.4) and x=4.8. Therefore the math notation of the domain and range of our function looks like D:{\( x \in R \)| \((-1.4)\le x\le 4.8\)} and R:{\(y \in R\)| \((-5.37)\le y\le 5.7\)}. </p>

  <p>\( y = 1.6 \frac{1}{0.2{x^2 }} - 3.8 \)</p>
  <h2>Transformations</h2>
  <p>
 We found an image of a roller coaster with part of its construction resembling the graph of an inverse quadratic function. Then, we applied transformations to the parent function from \(y= \frac{1}{x^2}\) to this \( y = 1.6 \frac{1}{0.2{x^2 }} - 3.8 \). These included a vertical stretch by a factor of 1.6, a horizontal stretch by a factor of \( \frac{1}{0.2}\) (which equals to 5), and a vertical translation of 3.8 units downward. The thinking process was similar to the one used for the rational function. After applying the transformations, we noticed that both horizontal and vertical stretches (or compressions) affect the width or steepness of the graph. Therefore, only one of them is needed to represent the change in shape - applying both would describe the same effect twice. As a result, we can represent the function as \( y = 8  \frac{1}{x^2}- 3.8 \) instead of the  \( y = 1.6 \frac{1}{0.2{x^2 }} - 3.8 \).   
</p>

  <h2>Domain and Range</h2>
 <p>
    We need to put restrictions on our function to make it fit the certain part of the roller coaster, that is why we used the intervals (-2.75;2.2)U(-3;2.3). Also, we needed to add restrictions for y-values to make it fit perfectly. Therefore the math notation of the domain and range of our function looks like D:{\( x \in R \)| \((-2.75)\le x\le 2.2\)} and R:{\(y \in R\)| \((-2.74)\le y\le 2.3\)}.

  <p>y=0.35(0.12(x+8)(x-2.75)(x-6))-4.5.</p>
  <h2>Transformations</h2>
  <p>
We found an image of a roller coaster with part of its construction resembling the graph of third degree polynomial function. We modeled it using transformations of the parent function y= x<sup>3</sup> in the form y=a(k(x-d)(x-e)(x-f))+c. We determined that the graph of our function needed to be vertically compressed by a factor of 0.35. Next, we observed that the function needed to be horizontally stretched. We knew that for a horizontal stretch, the value of “k” must be greater than 0 but less than 1. Therefore, we applied a horizontal stretch by a factor of \( \frac{1}{0.12}\). For the values of “d”, “e”, “f” we choose to write (-8), 2.75, and 6, because we needed our graph function to cross the x-axis at these points. Finally, the graph needed to be shifted vertically 4.5 units downward, so the value of “c” is (−4.5). After applying all of these transformations, we substituted the values into our formula and obtained the equation: y=0.35(0.12(x+8)(x-2.75)(x-6))-4.5. We also noticed again that the parameter "k" was not necessary, for the same reason as in the inverse quadratic function. As a result, we can represent the function as y=0.042(x+8)(x-2.75)(x-6)-4.5 instead of the y=0.35(0.12(x+8)(x-2.75)(x-6))-4.5. After applying all the required transformations, the graph of our function fits the construction well, although not perfectly. It could have been improved by defining it as a piecewise function (using two quadratic sections), but we decided to keep it as a single function since we were unable to find a construction to fit our function more accurately, we decided to keep this one.
</p>

  <h2>Domain and range</h2>
  <p>
    We need to put restrictions to our function to make it fit the certain part of the roller coaster, that is why we used the intervals from (-6.4) to 7.3. We knew that to determine the range of the function, we first needed to find the values of its extrema. Using Desmos, we identified the y-values at those points and found that the maximum value of y was approximately 6.84021. Initially, we decided to round it to 6.84 according to the rounding rule, but we realized that this would slightly cut off part of the graph. Therefore, we limited y to 6.841,though it is not the correct way to round. For the minimum value, we followed the same logic and rounded the number (−5.87833), which was found in Desmos by tracing, to (−5.88). As a result, our range is approximate rather than exact. Therefore the math notation of the domain and range of our function looks like D:{\( x \in R \)| \((-1.4)\le x\le 5\)} and R:{\(y \in R\)| \((-5.88)\le y\le 6.841\)}.

  <h2>Transformations</h2>
  <p>
    We found an image of a roller coaster with part of its construction resembling the graph of function of cotangent. We modeled it using transformations of the parent function y=cot(x) in the form y=a(cot(k(x-d)))+c. These included a vertical compression by a factor of 0.065, a horizontal stretch by a factor of  \( \frac{1}{0.75}\), a horizontal translation 0.2 units to the right, and a vertical translation of 2.65 units upward. The thinking process was similar to the one used for the rational function. After applying all of these transformations, we substituted the values into our formula and obtained the equation:

    We need to put restrictions to our function to make it fit the certain part of the roller coaster, that is why we used the intervals from (-3.7) to 0.1878. The range was found by tracing the corresponding y-values at x=−3.7 and x=0.1878. Therefore the math notation of the domain and range of our function looks like D:{\( x \in R \)| \((-3.7)\le x\le 0.1878\)} and R:{\(y \in R\)| \((-4.454)\le y\le 2.945\)}.

The thinking process was similar to the one used for the rational function. After applying all of these transformations, we substituted the values into our formula and obtained the equation: y=1.7sin(0.4(x-4.1))+7.2

  <h2>Domain and Range</h2>
 <p>We need to put restrictions to our function to make it fit the certain part of the roller coaster, that is why we used the intervals from (-15.62) to 13.4. We knew that to determine the range of the function, we first needed to find the values of its extrema. Using Desmos, we identified the y-values at those points and found that the maximum value of y is 8.9. For the minimum value, we followed the same logic and found that the minimum value of y is 5.5. Therefore the math notation of the domain and range of our function looks like D:{\( x \in R \)| \((-15.62)\le x\le 13.4\)} and R:{\(y \in R\)| \(5.5\le y\le 8.9\)}. </p>

We modeled it using transformations of the parent function y=2<sup>x</sup> in the form y=a(2<sup>k(x-d)</sup>)+c. These included a vertical stretch by a factor of 7.6, a reflection on the y axis,because we saw that our function needed to be reflected on y axis, so we added “-” sign before “k” in the formula, horizontal compression by a factor of \( \frac{1}{1.2}\), a horizontal translation 5.6 units to the left, and a vertical translation of 3.7 units downward. The thinking process was similar to the one used for the rational function. After applying all of these transformations, we substituted the values into our formula and obtained the equation:y=7.6 (2<sup>(-1.2(x+5.6))</sup>)-3.7.

  <p>We found an image of a roller coaster with part of its construction resembling the graph of logarithmic function. We modeled it using transformations of the parent function y=log(x) in the form y=a(log(k(x-d)))+c. These included a vertical reflection,because we saw that our function needed to be reflected on x axis, so we added “-” sign before “a” in the formula, a vertical stretch by a factor of 5.1, a horizontal compression by a factor of\( \frac{1}{10}\), a horizontal translation 1.2 units to the left, and a vertical translation of 5.5 units upward. The thinking process was similar to the one used for the rational function. After applying all of these transformations, we substituted the values into our formula and obtained the equation: y=(-5.1) (log(10(x+1.2))) +5.5. After we substituted all the values for the variables a, k, d, and c, we simplified our equation and realized that, by using the logarithm addition rule, we could write the equation without k and concluded that k is not necessary for the logarithmic function. Changing the value of c gives the same effect as changing k. As a result, we can represent the function as y=(-5.1)(log(x+1.2))+0.4 instead of the y=(-5.1)(log(10(x+1.2))) +5.5.

Therefore the math notation of the domain and range of our function looks like  D:{\( x \in R \)| \((-1.184)\le x\le 9.78\)} and R:{\(y \in R\)| \((-4.91)\le y\le 9.56\)}.

Here we did not add the “k” variables to the formula from the  beginning, due to its needlessness as we concluded in the inverse quadratic function. So our transformations included a vertical stretch by a factor of 1.1, a horizontal translation 1 units to the left, and a vertical translation of 9.3 units downward.

The thinking process was similar to the one used for the rational function. After applying all of these transformations, we substituted the values into our formula and obtained the equation:

After we substituted all the values for the variables "a", "k", "d", and "c", we simplified our equation and realized that we could write the equation without "k" and concluded that "k" is not necessary for the absolute function, because we noticed that both horizontal and vertical stretches (or compressions) affect the width or steepness of the graph.
