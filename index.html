    Transformations
</p>
<p>
We found an image of a roller coaster with part of its construction resembling the graph of a rational function. We modeled it using transformations of the parent function \( y = \frac{1}{x} \) in the form \( y = a\frac{1}{k(x - d)} + c \). First, we determined that our function needed to be vertically stretched. Since we did not want a vertical compression or a reflection across the x-axis, the value of “a” had to be greater than 1. Therefore, we applied a vertical stretch by a factor of 1.2. Next, we observed that the function needed to be horizontally stretched. We knew that for a horizontal stretch, the value of “k” must be greater than 0 but less than 1. Therefore, we applied a horizontal stretch by a factor of \(  \frac{1}{0.12} \) Then, we noticed that the graph needed to be shifted horizontally 2.2 units to the left, so the value of “d” is (−2.2) Finally, the graph needed to be shifted vertically 6.8 units downward, so the value of “c” is (−6.8). After applying all of these transformations, we substituted the values into our formula and obtained the equation: \( y = 1.2 \frac{1}{0.12(x + 2.2)} - 6.8 \)
